# node_app
2016/06/01

This app will save an API data to mongodb using expressjs to request and serve data that exists locally.
If data does not exists pull data from API and save to mongodb.

In a better logic order.

Node app that use express ES5 to serve data stored in mongodb using angular 2

This app has stopped.
Change this app to nodejs using ES6 written in typescript.

Use conventions and OOP design patterns I used when I wrote the stats service for manalto.
